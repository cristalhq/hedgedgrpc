Hedged Go GRPC client which helps to reduce tail latency at scale.

## Rationale

See paper [Tail at Scale](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2013/2/160173-the-tail-at-scale/fulltext) by Jeffrey Dean, Luiz Andr√© Barroso. In short: the client first sends one request, but then sends an additional request after a timeout if the previous hasn't returned an answer in the expected time. The client cancels remaining requests once the first result is received.
